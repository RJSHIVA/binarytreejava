## Description

This code provides implementations for various operations on binary trees. It includes methods for building a binary tree from an array, traversing the tree (inorder, preorder, postorder, and level order), calculating the height, count, and sum of nodes in the tree, finding the diameter of the tree, checking if two trees are identical, determining if a tree is a subtree of another tree, finding the top view of a tree, finding the kth level elements of a tree, finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, calculating the distance between two nodes, and finding the kth ancestor of a node. The code uses a combination of recursive and iterative approaches to perform these operations efficiently.

## Features

- Build a binary tree from an array
- Traverse the tree in different orders (inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
- Calculate the height, count, and sum of nodes in the tree
- Find the diameter of the tree
- Check if two trees are identical
- Determine if a tree is a subtree of another tree
- Find the top view of a tree
- Find the kth level elements of a tree
- Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes
- Calculate the distance between two nodes
- Find the kth ancestor of a node

## Usage
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Navigate to the INITIATION.java file.

Modify the code or use the existing methods as needed for your use case.

Compile and run the Java program to execute the operations on binary trees.
